########### TESTS SHOULD GO BELOW THIS LINE ###########

# INCLUDE YOUR TESTS FROM HW2 HERE.

## Add tests, as described in instructions.
## Here is a sample.
class HandClassTests(unittest.TestCase):
	def test_add_card(self):
		d = Deck()
		h = Hand(d) # default number of cards
		num = len(h.cards_in_hand) # length of the cards list in the hand
		new_card = d.pop_card() # pop another card off the deck
		h.add_card(new_card) # invoke add_card method with the card that we popped off the deck
		self.assertEqual(len(h.cards_in_hand),num+1) # Testing that the new number of cards in the hand is equal to the old number plus 1
	# Add more here!

## Hints to help come up with tests:
## - Create a Deck instance in each method where you want to test an instance of class Hand, because you need a Deck instance to create a Hand instance!
## - To test the Hand constructor, you may want to test that the Hand class creates a hand with 3 cards if you pass in a Deck instance to the constructor, and use the default num_cards.
## - You should also test that if you pass in a specific number of cards to the Hand class constructor, it creates an instance of class Hand with that specific number of cards! Gotta be sure that part of the Hand class constructor (__init__ method) works correctly.
