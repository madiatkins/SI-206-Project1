- What does this code do overall?
This code creates classes which allow users to create cards, decks, and hands in order to play a modified game of War. Additionally, the classes created in this code would allow a user to define new functions to create new card games.

- What does each class do?

Note: Each class builds off one another (i.e. Card() is necessary in Hand()). If you were to remove one, you would need to edit the following class in order for the code to work correctly.

Card():
An instance of the class Card() represents a single card from a typical playing card deck. 



Deck():
An instance of the class Deck() represents a typical 52-card deck of playing cards.


Hand():
An instance of the class Hand() represents a single hand of playing cards (5 cards, but can be changed).
